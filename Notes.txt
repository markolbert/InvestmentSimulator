Notes

Symbol AddAlias on RootCommand creation: Name property and alias appear to be competing for identifying Symbol. Why?

Option in ctor why is an Argument being created to wrap getDefaultValue? Why not just store getDefaultValue and 
assign it to Argument later, in case Argument gets created explicitly by the user?

What is if( x is {} y)?
